# Python-Fundamentals-Projects
In this repository, you will find a variety of notebooks containing Python code. I created exciting programs like Random Password Generator, Treasure Island Game and Rollercoaster Ticketing System. I made these programs to showcase my understanding of fundamental Python concepts like variables, data types, conditionals and loops.
