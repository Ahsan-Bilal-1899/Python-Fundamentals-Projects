# Python-Fundamentals-Projects
In this repository, you will find a variety of notebooks containing Python code. I created exciting programs from the Undemy Course - 100 Days of Coding in Python by Angela Yu. I made these programs to showcase my understanding of fundamental Python concepts like variables, data types, conditionals and loops.
